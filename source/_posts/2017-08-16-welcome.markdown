Hi, my name is Lucas Sena and welcome to my personal and blog.

The propose of this blog is I write somethings about my projects, things that I am learning and will be a way to I practice my english. Will be the first time that I create a blog and will be the first time too that Im writing in english. My english is not too good, so it will have a few grammatical errors and other errors that a person wich is learning english commits.

I am using Jekyll to generate this blog, so I'll be learning about this framework too.

I don't have any welcome text in mind to write here, so this first post it be only for introduce my blog to world and also who I am.
