Hi everyone, I will debut my blog talking about a very cool project that I am participating, the Dev#Translate.

The Dev#Translate is a project of translate which has the main goal translate contents related about IT for others languages. The project started with the idea to translate documentations and articles from english to portuguese, to include a part of the brazilian community who dosen't speack english. But the project has plans to expand, to translate the contents to several languages, and even translate contents in portuguese.

I decided participate translating a few contents from english to portugues, and vice-versa, because its a way to I pay back the community for all free content that I consumed along the years, and pratice my english too.

For more informations, just click on the link below to access the page of the project.
