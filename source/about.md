This is my personal blog where I'll write somethings about things that I like and about things that I'm learning, my projects and a lot of others things.

I have 8 years experience as developer, but only this year I decided to do an blog, so I have no experience in write anything, even more, write in english, which is not my primary language rs.

I'm using Jekyll, for generate this blog, so you can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

This theme was made by [Fernando Moreira](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/) called [End2End](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/end2end).
